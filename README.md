A WIP of an IOS app designed to provide a free-form, intuitive platform to play ANY card game.
Features to look forward to:
- Two modes of game play: free and structured.
    1.'Free mode' will simulate real-life card games as much as possible,
      so it is up to the user (who can customize settings) to keep track of the rules and such.
    2. In 'structured mode', users select a type of card game, and play with a set of rules and game state conditions.
- The hope is to eventually incorporate AI to be able to generate the constrained mode of any card game
  given textual rule sets, utilizing mostly classification and perhaps generation.
- Players should be able to make and release their own card game 'packages' online (constrained mode), playing with friends and such.
- Last but not least, we should allow easy customization of decks. I am personally a fan of elegant and gorgeous card decks.
