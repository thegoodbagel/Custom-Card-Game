# iOS Card Game App (WIP)

A work-in-progress iOS app designed to provide a free-form, intuitive platform to play **ANY** card game.

## Features to Look Forward To

- **Two Modes of Gameplay:**
  
  1. **Free Mode**  
     Simulates real-life card games as much as possible.  
     Users can customize settings and are responsible for keeping track of rules.
  
  2. **Structured Mode**  
     Users select a type of card game and play with a predefined set of rules and game state conditions.

- **AI Integration (Future Goal)**  
  The hope is to eventually incorporate AI that can generate the structured mode of any card game given textual rule sets, utilizing mostly classification and possibly generation techniques.

- **Multiplayer Interaction**  
  Players will be able to call, chat, and spam emojis while playing.

- **Custom Card Game Packages**  
  Players will be able to create and release their own card game packages online (for structured mode), enabling gameplay with friends and others.

- **Deck Customization**  
  Easy customization of decks is a priority. Personally, I am a fan of elegant and gorgeous card decks.
